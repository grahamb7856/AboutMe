## Pre-requisites
To complete this assignment, you will need to finish [Installfest](https://git.generalassemb.ly/SEBR-Tardigrade/Installfest) and have set up a [personal access token](https://git.generalassemb.ly/SEBR-Tardigrade/Installfest/blob/main/guides/GitHub%20Personal%20Access%20Token.md) on your [GitHub Enterprise account](https://git.generalassemb.ly). During class tomorrow we will walk through how we will use GitHub Enterprise to submit this deliverable.


## Deliverable Requirements
- Create an `index.html` and `styles.css` file.
- Connect your `styles.css` to your `index.html`
- Include an image of yourself
    - TIP: If you want a circular image, check out the `border-radius` CSS property...
- Include a brief bio about yourself, 3-6 sentences. You may discuss what brought you to GA, your passions, interests, etc.
- Create any links to social media or professional accounts that you'd wish to share with a hiring manager.
- Using an `<ol>` element, list 3 goals you want to accomplish by the time the cohort is over.
    - Example: *I hope to be able to build a mobile website that showcases my interest in Pokemon Cards*
- Be prepared to present your About Me page and it's code for 5 minutes in class


## Submission
We'll have a lesson on how we'll use Git & GitHub to submit your deliverables tomorrow, so there will be no official submission process you need to follow until then. For now, all that is required is that your About Me page is ready to present by the start of class tomorrow morning.
