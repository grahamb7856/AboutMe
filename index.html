                <p>Hi there! I'm Britney. I'm a and I'm soon to be a software engineer. I've always loved making things. There's just something about taking a step back and admiriing something you created. I've always been really crafty, and I'm constantly figuring out how to make new thigs. For a while, I've been wanting to explore software engineering, because I think building websites will be just as fun and satisfying. I'm looking forward to taking this journey with you all. Another big reason I'm interested in software engineering is that it's one of the few fields where working remotely is an option. This is important to me because my dream is to get an RV, and road-school my daughters. I think the information they learn would stick better going to museums and stuff like that, as opposed to sitting in a classroom.</p>
